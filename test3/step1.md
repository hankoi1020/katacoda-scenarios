Docker-Compose can define and run multi-container by using a YAML file to configure the containers. 

First of all, we need to make a YAML file `docker-compose.yml`

You can get this file by execute this command
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenpoon2000/katacoda-scenarios/main/test3/docker-compose.yml`{{execute}}

After download the yml file, you can start up the applications by execute command:
`docker-compose up`{{execute}}
