The scenario example showing how impoertant in privilege granting

Different level user should have suitable privilege 

We should prevent grant privilege more than the requirement

Think about what if a normal sale officer be able to view all the customer information, delete data even drop a database/table

It must be lead to many accident like data breach and data lost

Even a high level user like manager should not own the powerful privilege like DROP as well because normally Manager is not require DROP privilege in their task
