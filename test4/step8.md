## Sensitive Data

As you can see in example, the user provided sensitive data can be found in many place once you have admin permission

In our Wordpress / Woocommerce case, those data mainly are Name, address, email, device information and phone number

We can easily find these data on the wordpress by going to the User or order related pages

In MySQL case, we also just need to identify the related table as well to get these data
